# Waste Classification System ♻️

An AI-based web application that classifies waste materials (like plastic, paper, metal, organic, etc.) using a deep learning model built with Keras and integrated into a Node.js web app.

## Features
- Upload waste images and get instant classification results.
- Machine learning model (`keras_model.h5`) for accurate predictions.
- User and Admin modules for record management.
- Integrated with MSSQL database for storing user and waste info.
- Responsive UI built with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and EJS.

## Tech Stack
**Frontend:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, EJS  
**Backend:** Node.js, Express.js  
**Database:** Microsoft SQL Server (MSSQL)  
**Machine Learning:** Python (TensorFlow / Keras)
